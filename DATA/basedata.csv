The ability to grow the firm is effectively tied to the capacity of the firm’s investment professionals to generate attractive investment ideas. While the firm does not have a hard ceiling in terms of AUM at this point, its management believes that a doubling of its AUM would not impair its investment results.

As we have been reflecting on the environment, it has become clearer to us that investors want increasingly idiosyncratic investments that are well researched and risk managed. Therefore, we are strengthening our efforts in the small to mid cap value part of the market where our fundamental approach leads us to differentiated, undiscovered, and misunderstood opportunities.

As part of this process, we have made a determined effort to reduce the number of companies in which we are invested firm wide. We have made good progress and it is a continual process. We want to leverage our best ideas and by focusing on fewer names, it becomes a virtuous process of having the time and resources to develop the conviction to hold securities in larger weightings. Each strategy has reduced its total number of holdings and concentration continues to increase in the top half of the portfolios.

We are also enthusiastic about our Long/Short Equity strategy as it leverages our core capabilities in structuring a highly differentiated and concentrated portfolio with low correlation and strong risk management characteristics.","US Equity-o","United States","Partnership (3C7)","Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn LLC","Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn",2001-03-01,2016-03-31,0,NA,"[2001-03-01 -- 2016-03-31] Jamie O.

We capitalize on the change by buying companies that will benefit and selling or going short companies that will be hurt from the change. 
 
Our primary goal is generating extraordinarily high rates of return. In the “no free lunch” world of investment management, high returns must come with higher levels of volatility. We view volatility as a two-sided coin – one side being “good” upside volatility (which most investors do not object to) and the other side being “bad” downside volatility (which most investors object to). What HCM has succeeded in doing is capturing a disproportionate share (historically better than 2:1) of the “good” over the “bad.” In investment parlance, HCM investors have in years past received a lot of “alpha” for some “beta.”
 
Because of HCM’s unique stock selection process (investment themes and use of hurdles, driven by a 30-year industry veteran), HCM’s investment returns generally have a low correlation to the market. Hence, by including HCM in its stable of managers (which often include passive managers), an investor may increase diversification and thus improve the risk-return profile of its total overall portfolio. We would encourage prospective investors to analyze whether including HCM in their stable of managers improves the risk-return profile of their entire portfolio.

As part of this process, we have made a determined effort to reduce the number of companies in which we are invested firm wide. We have made good progress and it is a continual process.

Its aim as an active-equity manager is to deliver consistent, superior returns for clients globally. Martin Currie does this via its client focused range of outcome orientated equity investment solutions based on its four distinct product pillars, Market Aware, Long-Term Unconstrained, Sustainable Income and Growth and Absolute Returns. 

The delivery of investment excellence is central to what Martin Currie offers its clients. This means a clearly-articulated investment proposition: 
Committed to high-conviction active management
Martin Currie’s high-conviction, active management is driven by the rigour of its distinctive and repeatable research process. 
A collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to research, drawing on the knowledge of colleagues from across the investment floor, enables Martin Currie to identify and evaluate the mispricing of individual stocks – specifically for those companies that it believes will offer sustainable, long-term growth. This in-house research is always complemented by local market research, lateral industry insights, and company meetings. 
Of course, this is not a process in isolation. It is interwoven with a strong valuation discipline based on the forecasting of normalised earnings power, as well as risk, to determine a company’s fair value.
ESG analysis and active ownership are also fully embedded into Martin Currie’s investment process. This allows Martin Currie to engage with investee companies in order to better understand what motivates them and the mechanisms in place for decision-making. 
Overlaying all of this is an independent and dynamic risk function that informs an optimum risk allocation. All portfolios are continuously monitored for correlated, unintended and excessive risk. When market conditions change, the investment risk team provides Martin Currie’s portfolio managers with experienced interpretation of risk models to quantify the likely impact. As such, Martin Currie thinks of its independent risk team as being the representative of its clients within the firm.

"255","Diamond Capital Management LLC","US Dollar",NA,"FHUSA04AYK","Alternative","HF Equity Market Neutral","Diamond Capital Management relies heavily on selling or ""writing"" options on stock index futures. DCM may also, from time to time, purchase options and may employ the use of hedge strategies such as option spreads, straddles, strangles or may purchase or sell futures to offset an open option position. 

The profitability of a trading strategy consisting of selling (""writing"") options on an index depends upon the subsequent price movement of the index. It is the intention of Diamond to write mainly ""out-of-the-money"" puts and calls while seeking to sell into volatility. Thus, if the index remains within the predetermined trading range and the option remains ""out-of-the-money"" until the position is closed or expires, the puts and/or calls will be profitable. 

Diamond’s trading strategy is not dependent on market moves and is therefore suited to all types of market conditions. For example, instead of seeking to profit through the purchase of individual shares of stock, which are in the benchmark S&P 500 Index, DCM sells options on the Index itself. When writing options on the S&P 500 Index, the market can move up, down, or sideways within a specific range and still produce profits at, or as it nears, option expiration. Conversely, when buying stocks, the stock must move higher and/or pay good dividends to make the trade profitable.

It is Diamond's goal to produce consistent positive returns with a maximum monthly drawdown of less than 5 percent not to exceed 10 percent during any consecutive monthly periods. Rigorous risk management is used to minimize monthly drawdown's. As such, the trading strategies have pre-defined profit goals and risk exposure.

"414","HCM Classic Hedge","US Dollar",NA,"FHUSA04EE0","Alternative","HF U.S. Long/Short Equity","HCM makes money from good old-fashioned stock picking, not technical quantitative models (“black boxes”) or complicated credit bets. HCM’s stock ideas are centered on a relatively limited number of investment themes (typically 4-8) enabling the firm to be early identifiers of change (whether at a company, industry, sector, market or other level). We capitalize on the change by buying companies that will benefit and selling or going short companies that will be hurt from the change. 
 
Our primary goal is generating extraordinarily high rates of return. In the “no free lunch” world of investment management, high returns must come with higher levels of volatility. We view volatility as a two-sided coin – one side being “good” upside volatility (which most investors do not object to) and the other side being “bad” downside volatility (which most investors object to). What HCM has succeeded in doing is capturing a disproportionate share (historically better than 2:1) of the “good” over the “bad.” In investment parlance, HCM investors have in years past received a lot of “alpha” for some “beta.”
 
Because of HCM’s unique stock selection process (investment themes and use of hurdles, driven by a 30-year industry veteran), HCM’s investment returns generally have a low correlation to the market. Hence, by including HCM in its stable of managers (which often include passive managers), an investor may increase diversification and thus improve the risk-return profile of its total overall portfolio. We would encourage prospective investors to analyze whether including HCM in their stable of managers improves the risk-return profile of their entire portfolio. Also, HCM’s west coast location often affords us a unique investment perspective (resulting in portfolios not created with consensus thinking) and is another source of diversification when selecting investment managers.","US Equity Health Care-o","United States","Unstructured Hedge Fund","Husic Capital Management","Husic Capital Management",1993-10-01,2015-08-31,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"S&P 500 TR USD",2015-08-31,8047040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,750000,"Monetary",NA,NA,1.5,1.5,20,NA,0,NA,"No",NA

Although the firm has been managing money since 1996, it has had very limited marketing until about 2007. At about that time, Gaineswood established GIPS performance measurement, placed performance and characteristics information into a large number of databases, and began to market its services to institutions, family offices, and selected registered investment advisors (RIAs). The founder values performance of customer accounts highest among the firm’s objectives. With limited resources he has erred in favoring this over directing resources to competing needs with the exception of maintaining compliance and necessary systems for reporting, financial management, risk assessment, and employee retention. Gaineswood’s management successfully saw its AUM rise through this period. When it achieves a milestone of $100 million of AUM, it feels its interesting historical performance combined with the larger customer base will appeal to small and medium sized institutions. Its largest addition into a single account was $10 million in 2006, which accounted for a major percentage of total AUM. While Gaineswood would not rule out an addition of $50 million or more given this previous success, it is targeting additions of $10 million or lower presently. Given the firm’s products typically have an average market cap of slightly over $2 billion and very low trading turnover, capacity should be between $2 billion and $3 billion. The investment philosophy has been successfully applied to new areas previously, and there is no inherent reason why it would not be applicable to international or large cap sectors.","U.S. Equity-o","United States","Partnership (3C1)","Gaineswood Investment Management Inc","Gaineswood",2000-01-01,2014-10-20,0,NA,"[2000-01-01 -- 2014-10-20] William W.

They do not plan to diversify into other areas of financial services or any other business activity outside their core competency.

As mentioned earlier, they have six core strategies: GEM, Asia, Asian Small Cap, Frontier, China and India. In due course they plan to add a GEM Small Cap capability. Their primary strategic objective continues to be to provide their existing clients with superior investment performance and strong client service. As investors they look for quality companies with sustainable business models and, understandably, their own ambition is to grow our business over the long term at a pace commensurate with their resources and market liquidity by expanding their existing high quality client base.

As far as client type is concerned, their main focus will continue to be institutional rather than direct retail and with broad geographic diversity. They consider all geographies - Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific - to be key growth areas for new clients.

Capacity is not an issue for LGM in the foreseeable future except for their Frontier Markets Strategy which is currently close to their pre-determined capacity of US$1bn. Any soft product close would be announced to all clients and pipeline investors at the same time, strategy asset flows would be monitored carefully, and no new marketing activities would be undertaken for the strategy. A hard close would mean that no further asset inflows would be accepted from any investors (existing or potential clients), in order to protect the interests of ongoing client relationships.

Clients may invest in their strategies either through a separate account or pooled/mutual fund vehicles such as LGM’s Irish domiciled UCIT IV funds.

The firm currently manages 164 accounts for 136 clients in North America, UK, Europe and Japan. Over time, we expect that number to increase to approximately 175 clients and 250 accounts, assuming that some clients will invest in more than one investment product. As the number of lead relationships assigned to each portfolio manager approaches 10, we expect to add to our investment staff, typically in advance of need, in order to maintain the high level of service and accountability our clients have come to expect. We reinvest our revenues in our information and investment technology, continually working to enhance our research and portfolio management capabilities and increase the efficiency of our investment process. We focus on product development, particularly in areas that are a natural extension of our current investment process. In US markets, for example, we continue to review the viability of strategies that are extensions of our current core style, such as growth and value, that might appeal to our client base.

The theory backing this was published in the FAJ, essentially the elemental drivers of stock price are related to earnings and liquidity. Importantly, it is by avoiding or underweighting extremely high liquidity and not by owning extreme illiquidity that we obtain value added. 
Second, we do not optimize to client benchmarks and so try to minimize tracking error risk, but instead maximize our expected excess return by optimizing to a reference portfolio (an index that we construct ourselves) that is more efficient – which means we do not ‘hug the benchmark’. 
Thirdly, we combine this with an investment factor trend signal that is dynamic in nature; in other words, different factors will matter at different points in time. This valuation metric is designed to capture mid to long-term investor behavior, which will generally shift through time. The ability to adjust to a variety of market conditions has allowed us to outperform through a variety of investor themes (e.g. deep value environment, strong growth theme, energy demand theme, risk aversion theme). We believe that adaptability will continue to be the cornerstone of our process and will allow us to add value in the foreseeable future, regardless of what investor themes surface. These two main valuation metrics have zero to negative correlation to each other, which makes them extremely attractive compliments, but the first of these two has, and is expected to add the most value.
Finally, we apply judgmental special situations work that complements our investment strategy and consistently adds value.","Market Neutral-o","United States","Limited Liability Company","Denali Advisors LLC","Denali",2003-05-30,2013-09-27,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-Month T-Bill: Secondary Market Rate",2013-02-28,36192296,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,20,"Negotiable",NA,NA,"Yes",NA

The delivery of investment excellence is central to what Martin Currie offers its clients. This means a clearly-articulated investment proposition: 
Committed to high-conviction active management
Martin Currie’s high-conviction, active management is driven by the rigour of its distinctive and repeatable research process. 
A collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to research, drawing on the knowledge of colleagues from across the investment floor, enables Martin Currie to identify and evaluate the mispricing of individual stocks – specifically for those companies that it believes will offer sustainable, long-term growth. This in-house research is always complemented by local market research, lateral industry insights, and company meetings. 
Of course, this is not a process in isolation. It is interwoven with a strong valuation discipline based on the forecasting of normalised earnings power, as well as risk, to determine a company’s fair value.
ESG analysis and active ownership are also fully embedded into Martin Currie’s investment process. This allows Martin Currie to engage with investee companies in order to better understand what motivates them and the mechanisms in place for decision-making. 
Overlaying all of this is an independent and dynamic risk function that informs an optimum risk allocation. All portfolios are continuously monitored for correlated, unintended and excessive risk. When market conditions change, the investment risk team provides Martin Currie’s portfolio managers with experienced interpretation of risk models to quantify the likely impact. As such, Martin Currie thinks of its independent risk team as being the representative of its clients within the firm.

Its aim as an active-equity manager is to deliver consistent, superior returns for clients globally. Martin Currie does this via its client focused range of outcome orientated equity investment solutions based on its four distinct product pillars, Market Aware, Long-Term Unconstrained, Sustainable Income and Growth and Absolute Returns. 

The delivery of investment excellence is central to what Martin Currie offers its clients. This means a clearly-articulated investment proposition: 
Committed to high-conviction active management
Martin Currie’s high-conviction, active management is driven by the rigour of its distinctive and repeatable research process. 
A collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to research, drawing on the knowledge of colleagues from across the investment floor, enables Martin Currie to identify and evaluate the mispricing of individual stocks – specifically for those companies that it believes will offer sustainable, long-term growth. This in-house research is always complemented by local market research, lateral industry insights, and company meetings. 
Of course, this is not a process in isolation. It is interwoven with a strong valuation discipline based on the forecasting of normalised earnings power, as well as risk, to determine a company’s fair value.
ESG analysis and active ownership are also fully embedded into Martin Currie’s investment process. This allows Martin Currie to engage with investee companies in order to better understand what motivates them and the mechanisms in place for decision-making.

There are currently no limits or a set amount of total assets under management for the firm, and due to the very high-quality, large-cap nature of the investment strategies, there are no foreseeable capacity limits or other total AUM issues in the near- to medium-term future. The objective is always to consistently add value and, as a result, if it is determined that AUM in any of the products become a limiting factor in achieving excess returns, Aletheia will further evaluate capacity limits. Furthermore, Aletheia’s team approach to its investment management services, supported by the firm’s Client Service, Operational, Compliance and other personnel, offers tremendous leverage with regard to the management of Aletheia’s client portfolios. Additionally, portfolios within a given strategy (subject to client specific restrictions and constraints) are all managed to an active model portfolio, which enables substantial precision and efficiency during the implementation of investment and portfolio changes. 

Aletheia has no plans to be involved in any acquisitions either as a buyer or a seller, as the firm believes its independent and management-controlled structure is the most ideal structure through which to provide investment management services to our clients. However, Aletheia will thoughtfully consider new strategies as appropriate and may add additional strategies in the future or create new vehicles through which our clients can invest our strategies. Over the last several years, Aletheia has invested significantly in its business to enhance the firm’s ability to meet client needs and objectives. This has been evidenced in the past few years with outstanding additions to the Investment Management, Research, Client Service, Compliance, Finance and Operations staff, as well as significant investment in plant and equipment and IT and back-office support resources.","Aletheia Insider Index-o","United States","Partnership (3C1)","Aletheia Research and Management Inc","Aletheia",2000-06-30,2012-10-01,0,NA,"[2000-05-01 -- 2012-10-01] Peter J.

The valuation models incorporate fundamental, ESG, technical, as well as value, growth and momentum factors from multiple categories including: 1) a firm's financial statements, 2) analyst's earnings and growth estimates, 3) price and trading volume information, 4) management actions such as share issuance/repurchase, debt issuance/retirement and changes in dividends, 5) unique financial data specific to the REIT industry, 6) environmental, social and governance characteristics, 7) valuation methods such as the Dividend Discount Model, and 8) trading data such as volume and bid/ask spreads. Quotient looks at this information both in terms of relative comparisons between companies in the same industry and trends over time. Quotient builds a unique model for each industry based on the price drivers that are predictive in that industry. In total, there is a unique valuation model for each of the 56 industries that the firm follows.","Quotient Focused Market Neutral-o","United States","Partnership (3C1)","Quotient Investors, LLC","Quotient",2003-01-03,2012-08-01,0,NA,"[2003-01-03 -- 2012-08-01] Andre Bertolotti",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2008-12-31,2008-12-31,175,NA,NA,NA,NA,5e+06,"Monetary",NA,NA,1,NA,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Saddle Peak’s investment strategy is value oriented. Saddle Peak seeks to acquire long positions in undervalued companies where, in the opinion of the advisor, the value of the company’s assets and/or earnings power are not accurately reflected by the company’s current market price. Each position entered into is the result of the application of a valuation methodology the advisor uses to arrive at an estimate of the company’s true worth, or intrinsic value. Saddle Peak’s philosophy is to make investments that trade at a steep discount to intrinsic value thus providing both a large margin of safety against a decline in the company’s market price and a superior potential for appreciation. Saddle Peak believes that appreciation over time is best accomplished by minimizing capital loss and it views this “margin of safety” as a critical component to avoiding loss. When opportunities with attractive risk reward characteristics are scarce, the advisor may hold a significant portion of its assets in cash with a view toward preserving capital. A position will generally be closed out when the price approaches intrinsic value.

THE HEDGE
The hedge fund is a long/short equity fund whose assets are invested in an actively managed portfolio of domestic stocks, options, and certain futures interest. The partnership’s portfolio is expected to have a bias toward long positions. However, it may have a short bias at times depending on the assessment of the overall market. Short positions generally will be used for hedging purposes, rather than to capture a price swing or trend to the downside. In addition to short sales, put option on individual companies, market indices or industries may be used to offset the portfolio’s long positions. Although the use of leverage is not contemplated, some leverage may be used on occasion to increase the capacity for investments. 

In each case, Saddle Peak seeks good absolute returns through a focused portfolio of value-oriented, multi-capitalization investments. Saddle Peak will generally not be invested in more than 25 to 30 companies at any one time. Control of risk is constantly measured and positions will generally be closed when the price approaches its target price intrinsic value.","Long/Short Composite-o","United States","Registered Hedge Fund","Saddle Peak Asset Management, LLC","Saddle Peak Asset Management",2006-01-03,2018-08-31,0,NA,"[2006-01-03 -- 2018-08-31] Douglas Grey",NA,NA,NA,2017-09-30,12972927,NA,NA,2008-12-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,1e+06,"Monetary",NA,NA,1,NA,20,NA,NA,NA,"Yes",NA

"802","Sofaer Capital European HF USD A","US Dollar",NA,"FHUSA04D7I","Alternative","HF Europe Long/Short Equity","At Martin Currie, strategic planning is oriented to the overall quality of the firm, with a primary focus on delivering investment excellence. Its aim as an active-equity manager is to deliver consistent, superior returns for clients globally. Martin Currie does this via its client focused range of outcome orientated equity investment solutions based on its four distinct product pillars, Market Aware, Long-Term Unconstrained, Sustainable Income and Growth and Absolute Returns. 

The delivery of investment excellence is central to what Martin Currie offers its clients. This means a clearly-articulated investment proposition: 
Committed to high-conviction active management
Martin Currie’s high-conviction, active management is driven by the rigour of its distinctive and repeatable research process. 
A collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to research, drawing on the knowledge of colleagues from across the investment floor, enables Martin Currie to identify and evaluate the mispricing of individual stocks – specifically for those companies that it believes will offer sustainable, long-term growth. This in-house research is always complemented by local market research, lateral industry insights, and company meetings. 
Of course, this is not a process in isolation. It is interwoven with a strong valuation discipline based on the forecasting of normalised earnings power, as well as risk, to determine a company’s fair value.
ESG analysis and active ownership are also fully embedded into Martin Currie’s investment process. This allows Martin Currie to engage with investee companies in order to better understand what motivates them and the mechanisms in place for decision-making. 
Overlaying all of this is an independent and dynamic risk function that informs an optimum risk allocation. All portfolios are continuously monitored for correlated, unintended and excessive risk. When market conditions change, the investment risk team provides Martin Currie’s portfolio managers with experienced interpretation of risk models to quantify the likely impact. As such, Martin Currie thinks of its independent risk team as being the representative of its clients within the firm.
The responsibility for the creation and implementation of the firm’s plan sits with the executive committee, chaired by Chief Executive Officer, Julian Ide.","Europe Equity-o","United States","Unstructured Hedge Fund","Martin Currie Inc","Legg Mason",2004-04-01,2010-07-30,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1e+06,"Monetary",NA,NA,1,NA,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We understand that strong past performance is no guarantee of future performance, and, therefore, constantly strive to identify innovative ways to strengthen our process and improve client returns.

Through its value-oriented predecessors, TAM’s roots can be traced back to 1967. In 1986, TIA adopted its unique methodology using intrinsic value to identify a stock’s true underlying value. Today, with more than 30 years of experience with the methodology, TAM believes Price/Intrinsic Value is still the most effective fundamental tool to determine the true valuation of a stock. The Price/Intrinsic Value philosophy is the foundation of all of the firm's equity strategies. 

Todd Asset Management LLC plans to increase assets under management by at least 20-30% over the next three years. There have been several developments over the past year to both drive and support this growth:

1. We have won several institutional mandates since 6/30/2014 totaling more than $350 million in assets under management.

2. The firm's relationship with Advisors Asset Management, established in 2014, has resulted in TAM strategies being added to a large retail broker dealer platform and is actively generating new accounts. 

3. On July 1, 2014, we launched a new product, International Intrinsic Value Opportunity, with $100 million

4. We launched a commingled product for our International Intrinsic Value strategy that funded during 4Q 2018.

5. The firm started building a third generation portfolio management team in October 2014 with the promotion of Shaun Siers, CFA, from Research Analyst to Portfolio Manager. Jeremy Roane, Research Analyst, was added in October 2016.

In addition, we will continue to cultivate our consultant relationships, sub-advisory opportunities, and respond to RFPs to increase assets.","U.S. Equity-o","United States","Partnership (3C1)","Todd Asset Management","Todd-Veredus",1993-09-01,2011-10-20,0,NA,"[1993-09-01 -- 2011-10-20] B.

Currently, DGHM offers six investment strategies, each focusing solely on domestic equity investments. It is important to note that every product has a capacity limit, and DGHM will close the products when achieving this level to protect the integrity of the product and always conduct business in the best interests of the firm’s clients. 	
DGHM is in strong financial condition. The revenue base is well diversified by client type, product, and distribution channel. Revenues are projected to grow, EBITDA margins are above 20%, and the firm has no debt with net cash on the balance sheet. DGHM does not anticipate any major capital requirements, and the firm has been cash flow positive every year since inception. DGHM's clientele is distributed in an even fashion across the pension, foundation, endowment, wealth management (including offshore) channels.

"855","TFMS Best Ideas","US Dollar",NA,"FOUSA08YB0","Alternative","HF U.S. Long/Short Equity","""Trust & Fiduciary Management Services Inc. has a business strategy based on widespread application of its pioneering development of diversified portfolios of exchange traded pass through securities, i. e. entities which are exempt from federal corporate income tax on the condition that they distribute substantially all of their profits to shareholders. The most widely recognized such entities are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT's); Master Limited Partnerships (MLP's); Business Development Companies (BDC's); Royalty Trusts; and Closed End Funds. TFMS believes that this strategy is the most practical and effective means of providing reliable income to investors in the emerging secular bear market for traditional fixed income securities. In addition, the firm provides a variety of other investment styles to support clients' needs for broad diversification in their portfolios.
Income based pass through strategies are offered in both active and passive investment styles. The active management style is called Matrix Income (tm) and has a twelve year GIPS compliant, independently verified track record. It is currently offered in separately managed accounts (SMA's) and in a traditional 1940 Act compliant open end mutual fund. Applications of this style in multi-manager income oriented mutual funds and closed end funds are being pursued. The passive investment style is embodied in the High Income Pass Through Securities (HIPS) 300 Index, calculated for TFMS by S&P Dow Jones. Applications of this index are contemplated in ETF, Index Fund, and private portfolio licensing.

Client retention is a major focus. Our firm’s goal is to meet or exceed clients’ needs and expectations in all aspects of the client relationship. We continuously reinvest in our investment and client service teams to enhance the client experience. We have a dual strategy to promote new business development: growth within current equity offerings and growth through distribution channels. Along those lines, we have organized our firm to insulate portfolio managers and analysts from business management responsibilities. Our firm is structured into three divisions: investment management, business services, and distribution (sales and service). Business services include legal and compliance, finance, human resources, operations, and facilities management. Distribution includes firm-wide marketing services, as well as institutional and private client distribution.
